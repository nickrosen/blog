  "body": "**Update 7/1/19**\n\nSo, I got the iframe stuff working for different device sizes, but because you can't interact with the DOM through an iFrame this didn't feel like a stable base to build on so I started thinking about using the new experimental portal feature shipping in chrome canary but building on top of an experimental feature in an experimental browser also seems foolhardy.\n\nOn 6/27 I saw this tweet about Sizzy, which is looking to solve the same problem but they built a whole new browser which looks cool but I don't want to open a special browser when I need this sort of tool, I'll link to the tweet below if you're interested.  Even though, this isn't exactly what I want, it looks great and definitely kick started my brain thinking about how to get what I want and I think the answer may be a browser extension.  When exploring the capabilities of browser extensions, it inspired a bunch of ideas so I'm going to dedicate some time to learning browser extension development and I'll try to blog things as I learn.\n\nHere's the referenced tweet:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m *extremely* excited to announce <a href=\"https://t.co/DQiFfTdVj5\">https://t.co/DQiFfTdVj5</a> - The Responsive Design Browser 🎉 🎊 🔥 🥁 🎺 🥳<br><br>YES! An actual browser for designers and developers 🤩 <br>Tons of amazing features and even more coming soon! 😎<br><br>3 random people who RT will get a lifetime license 👌 🎫 <a href=\"https://t.co/PZZI1VPxia\">pic.twitter.com/PZZI1VPxia</a></p>&mdash; Kitze (@thekitze) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1144147293786005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n**\\---------------------------**\n\nI got a bit stuck in the loop of jamming through quick tutorials to learn new skills but wasn't really building anything useful.  I decided to break through it by building a tool that saves me time in my workflow.\n\nI'll setup a custom url at some point but for the moment you can find it here <https://ecstatic-volhard-0317b0.netlify.com/>\n\nThe first built functionality is basically a bunch of iframes set at different device dimensions that can be scaled so you cna see a bunch of layout sizes at a time for your project in one tab.  This functionality is mostly done, I have a state management issue to fix with scaling and layout cleanup for the range inputs.  I was pleasantly surpirsed that hot reloading of my dev server worked fine through an iframe on another dev server.\n\nNext feature will be ability to write media queries at each size with a quick copy paste available."
