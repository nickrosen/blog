  "body": "After seeing all these new Netlify CMS powered blogs popping up after the revolt from medium, I really wanted to give one a go using Nuxt JS for my front end.\n\nNow that it's more or less built the challenge will be actually posting.  I think I'm going to mostly write about stuff I learn (not code specific), rubber duck problems, reducing my carbon footprint and whatever else I get into between then and now.\n\nI decided to build my own blog rather than go with a solution like Medium because I wanted to and I keep hearing that you should own your platform whenever your able, even though I'm not really expecting to have much of an audience."
