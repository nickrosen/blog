  "body": "So I started out by googling 'San Diego Historical Weather Data' and didn't come up with much so I decided to write a scraper to grab what I need from Wunderground.  Unfortunately, my scraper got blocked, so I was thinking about tweaking my scraper to use proxies and mess with request headers to see if I can get around Wunderground's bot security.  Since I've been working on Web Extensions lately, I went down a little rabbit hole of building a scraping web extension because it should eliminate the issues of making server side requests, but I remembered the original task and abandoned this idea(for now) and went back to google.\n\nAfter some deeper Googling I found [NOAA's bulk data store](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) and it turns out the data I want is free.  I forgot to mention that part of my requirements, I don't want to pay for the data.  Anyway, I was able to download a dataset collected at an airport weather station from Jan. 1, 1940 through now that has daily temp hi and low and precipitation.  I downloaded the data as a csv and will scrub out the junk in excel/sheets/numbers and write a formula to export it as a big json file.\n\nMy next step will be storing the file on my site and fetching the data onto my visualization page."
