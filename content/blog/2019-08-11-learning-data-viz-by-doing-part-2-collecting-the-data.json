  "body": "So I'm looking for historical weather data for San Diego, ideally a daily high, low and precipitation measurement and maybe humidity as well.  Where do I start?  Google, 'Bulk San Diego Historical wether data'.  I didn't find any data sets that are ready to go but it looks like <a href=\"https://www.wunderground.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather Underground</a> has all of the data I could possibly need and a url structure that should make scraping it pretty easy, hopefully there won't be some captcha thing that thwarts my scraper."
