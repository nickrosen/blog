  "body": "Like most people, I'm concerned with climate change but when I asked myself what I'm actually doing to fix it, the honest answer was nothing beyond putting recyclables in the blue bin.  It seems like the real way to fix climate change is systemic but in the meantime, I'm making an effort to make less trash and reduce the environmental impact of my diet.  Here's what I've tried so far.\n\n## Bags bags all kinds of bags:\n\nIn CA we now have to bring our own bags shopping or pay for a new bag at checkout.  I've been using [baggu's](https://baggu.com/) for a while now and they're great, I recently started using [mesh produce bags ](https://smile.amazon.com/Reusable-Lavinrose-Drawstring-Overlock-Stitched-See-Through/dp/B07MFTYJ16/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3P5QW4R34VG54&keywords=mesh+produce+bags&qid=1561405638&s=gateway&sprefix=mesh+produce%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-10)which means I no longer need the disposable one's from the store.  I have also mostly switched from disposable ziplocs to [reusable sandwich bags](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=reusable+sandwich+bags&crid=2OQNE24HEYK0R&sprefix=reusable+%2Caps%2C193&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_9) for things like salads, breads and leftovers.\n\n## Food & Drink\n\nI was drinking a lot of plain soda water (maybe 18-20 cans/week) and I felt a little guilty about all the waste, even though it was recyclable.  I switched to a [sodastream](https://sodastream.com/) and am really enjoying that there is zero waste and the soda water tastes the same.  I'm also making an effort to transition to more veggie/vegan meals both for the environmental impact and the way I feel after eating."
