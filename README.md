Live demo [here](https://nuxt-netlifycms-boilerplate.netlify.com/).

I wanted to build a website with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) but couldn't find any simple, well-documented templates that worked with the latest version of Nuxt, so I built my own! I hope you find it useful. ðŸ™‚

Many thanks to [Jake 101](https://jake101.com/), whose [Bael Template](https://github.com/jake-101/bael-template) served as a useful reference point as I built this.
